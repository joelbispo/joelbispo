### Olá 

🖤 **I'm a black man.** 

👶🏾 I've been a technology lover since I was a child. I started programming at 14 years old, making my first websites for friends and businesses in my neighborhood. 
👨🏾‍🎓 I went to university to go deeper on all of that technology that has been fascinating me so taking there a Computer Engineering program in 2010.
👨🏾‍💻 Since then I have been able to code and create computer systems professionally from simple webpages to the most complex machine that humanity has ever built (Lithography machines). 
🌍 I've lived in some countries such as Australia where I did part of my graduation studies, now I live in the Netherlands.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a black man. 
I've been a technology lover since I was a child. I started programming at 14 years old, making my first websites for friends and businesses in my neighborhood. I went to university to go deeper on all of that technology that has been facinating me so I tooking there a Computer Engineering program in 2010 and since then I have been able to code and create softwares professionally. I've lived in some countries such as Australia where I did part of my gratudation studies, now I live in the Netherlands, glad still working with software development. Currently I work exclusively with Python and C ++, which are the languages that I master.

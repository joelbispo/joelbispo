### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a black man. 
I've been a technology lover since I was a child. I started programming at 14 years old, making my first websites for friends and businesses in my neighborhood. I went to university to go deeper on all of that technology that has been facinating me so tooking there a Computer Engineering program in 2010 and since then I have been able to code and create computer systems professionally from simple webpages to the most complex machine that humanity has ever built (Lithography machines). I've lived in some countries such as Australia where I did part of my gratudation studies, now I live in the Netherlands.
